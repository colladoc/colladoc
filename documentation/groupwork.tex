% section Group Work
This section describes the division of work. The initial stage of the development process was  devoted to learning the Scala language and studying the code of the original system. For optimal productivity each team member focused on one or two sections of the system. We divided the work so that dependencies between team membersâ€™ tasks were minimal which is a key point of parallel development.
